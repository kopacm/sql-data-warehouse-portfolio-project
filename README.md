# SQL Data warehouse portfolio project 

With this project I built data warehouse with SQL Server, including ETL processes, data modeling

My approach:
- I watched YouTube tutorials from the channel Data with Baraa and took notes.
- I practiced on my own to gain not only theoretical knowledge but also practical experience.
- While I practiced I created a reusable template to support future projects.
